Welcome to the **React Todo List** repository! This project showcases a simple yet effective todo list application built using React and TypeScript. It serves as a great example of how to manage state and share data between components using Context API and hooks like `useState` and `useContext`.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todo items.
- Share data between components using React Context API.
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Built with TypeScript for better type safety and development experience.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Context API**: A way to share values between components without having to explicitly pass props through every level of the tree.
- **Hooks**: `useState` and `useContext` for managing state and context.

## Getting Started

To get started with the React Todo List, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aisha-0118/React-todo-list.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd React-todo-list
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Add new todo items by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
